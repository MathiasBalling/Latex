\section{PDE}
Partial Differential Equations are equations with multiple variables and derivatives.
They are used to model many physical phenomena, such as heat, sound, and light.
The totality of solutions to a PDE is called its general solution, and there can be a lot.

\subsection{Classification of PDEs}
General representation of a PDE:
\[
  A\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}+B\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x\partial y}+C\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2}+D\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+E\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+Fu=G
\]
\[
  Au_{xx}+Bu_{xy}+Cu_{yy}+Du_x+Eu_y+Fu=G
\]
Conditions:
%todo: Is this correct?

$$\begin{array}{l}
\textbf{Linear: }A,B,C,D,E,F \text{ are constants}\\
\textbf{Quasi-linear: }A,B,C \text{ are constants}\\
\textbf{Fully non-linear: }A,B,C,D,E,F \text{ are functions of u and its partial derivatives}
\end{array}$$

\subsection{Wave Equation (1D)}
One dimensional wave equation is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\quad\quad\text{where }c^2=\left[\frac{T(x,t)}{\mu_x}\right]
  \label{eq:wave1d}
\end{equation}
Steps to solve:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Method of Separation of Variables $\quad u(x,t)=X(x)T(t)$
  \item Satify the Boundary Conditions test
  \item Fourier Series Validation

\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{D’Alembert’s Solution of the Wave Equation}
His solution is given by \cref{eq:wave1d} but extended to two variables:
\begin{equation}
  v=(x-ct) \quad\quad\quad\quad w=(x+ct)
  \label{eq:dalambert}
\end{equation}
I.e. $u(v,w)$. Partial derivatives from chain rule:
\[
  u_x=u_v \cdot v_x+u_w\cdot w_x=u_v+u_w
\]
For double derivatives:
\[
  u_{xx}=(u_v+u_w)_x=(u_v+u_w)_v v_x+(u_v+u_w)_w w_x=u_{vv}+2u_{vw}+u_{ww}
\]
With respect to $t$:
\[
  u_{tt}=c^2u_{xx}=c^2(u_{vv}+2u_{vw}+u_{ww})
\]
From \cref{eq:wave1d} and \cref{eq:dalambert}:
\[
  u_{vw}=\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial w \partial v}=0
\]
This can be solved by integrating with respect to $v$ and $w$:
\[
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial v}=h(v) \text{ and } u=\int h(v)\ dv + \psi(w)
\]
Here, $h(v)$ and $\psi(w)$ are arbitrary functions of $v$ and $w$, respectively.
The solution in term for $x$:
\[
  u=\phi(v)+\psi(w)
\]
This is d'Alembert's solution, which is the general solution to the wave equation.
\[
  u(x,t)=\phi(x+ct)+\psi(x-ct)
\]
This solution satisfies the wave equation and the initial conditions:
