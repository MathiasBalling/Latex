\section{System-analysis}
\subsection{Impulse response}
The impulse response of a discrete-time system is called $h(n)$, and is identical to the output sequence of the system when the input sequence is a unit sample $\delta(n)$

The impulse response sequence $h(n)$ of a system is found by inverse z-transformation of the system's transfer function $H(z)$.

\subsection{Stability}
\textbf{Stable system:} A system is stable if its impulse response $h(n)$ goes to zero when $n$ goes to infinity.
$$|h(n)|\to 0 \quad\text{when }n\to \infty$$
If all poles of the transfer function $H(z)$ are inside the unit circle.
$$|p_i|\leq 1\quad\text{for }i=1,2,\dots,N$$

\textbf{Marginally stable system:} A system is marginally stable if its impulse response $h(n)$ approaches a constant value different from zero or oscillates with constant amplitude and frequency as it approaches infinity.

If one pole of the transfer function $H(z)$ are on the unit circle and the rest are inside.
$$|p_i|\leq 1\quad\text{for }i=1,2,\dots,N$$
$$|p_j|= 1\quad\text{for }j\in\{1,2,\dots,N\}$$

\textbf{Unstable system:} A system is unstable if its impulse response $h(n)$ grows indefinitely as it approaches infinity.
$$|h(n)|\to \infty \quad\text{when }n\to \infty$$
If one pole of the transfer function $H(z)$ are outside the unit circle.
$$|p_j|> 1\quad\text{for }j\in\{1,2,\dots,N\}$$

\subsection{Frequency response analysis}
A frequency response analysis gives the response of a system at a sinusoidal input sequence.
$$y(n)=AM(\omega)\cos(\omega t+\varphi(\omega))$$
where
$$M(\omega)=|H(j\omega)| \qquad \qquad\varphi(\omega)=\angle H(j\omega)$$
$$H(j\omega)=H(z)|_{z=e^{j\omega}T}\qquad\qquad H(j\omega)=|H(\omega)|\angle\varphi(\omega)$$
